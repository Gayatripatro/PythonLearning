# Encapsulation
ðŸ‘‰ Encapsulation is a fundamental programming technique used to achieve data hiding in OOP.

> Encapsulation in OOP refers to binding data and the methods to manipulate that data together in a single unit, that is, class.

ðŸ‘‰ Encapsulation is usually done to hide the state and representation of an object from outside. 

ðŸ‘‰ A class can be thought of as a capsule having methods and properties inside it.

> When encapsulating classes, a good convention is to declare all variables of a **class private**. This will restrict direct access by the code outside that class.

## **If the methods and variables are encapsulated in a class, then how can they be used outside of that class?**

**Ans:** One has to implement public methods to let the outside world communicate with this class. These methods are called getters and setters. We can also implement other custom methods.


### Advantages of encapsulation

ðŸ‘‰ Classes make the code easy to change and maintain.
ðŸ‘‰ Properties to be hidden can be specified easily.
ðŸ‘‰ We decide which outside classes or functions can access the class properties.

### Getters and Setters

ðŸ‘‰ In order to allow controlled access to properties from outside the class, getter and setter methods are used.

> A getter method allows reading a propertyâ€™s value.
> 
> Syntax: **getproperty(value)**

> A setter method allows modifying a propertyâ€™s value.
> 
>  Syntax: **setproperty(value)**


```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, username=None):  # defining initializer
        self.__username = username

    def setUsername(self, x):
        self.__username = x

    def getUsername(self):
        return (self.__username)


Steve = User('steve1')
print('Before setting:', Steve.getUsername()) -------->Before setting: steve1

Steve.setUsername('steve2')
print('After setting:', Steve.getUsername()) --------->After setting: steve2
```

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, userName=None, password=None):
        self.__userName = userName
        self.__password = password

    def login(self, userName, password):
        if ((self.__userName.lower() == userName.lower())
                and (self.__password == password)):
            print(
                "Access Granted against username:",
                self.__userName.lower(),
                "and password:",
                self.__password)
        else:
            print("Invalid Credentials!")


# created a new User object and stored the password and username
Steve = User("Steve", "12345")
Steve.login("steve", "12345")  # Grants access because credentials are valid

# does not grant access since the credentails are invalid
Steve.login("steve", "6789")
#Steve.__password  # compilation error will occur due to this line
```

> **Note: For encapsulating a class, all the properties should be private and any access to the properties should be through methods such as getters and setters.**
