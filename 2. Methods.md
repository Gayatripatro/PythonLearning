## Implementing Methods in a Class

 Methods act as an interface between a program and the properties of a class in the program.
 
 A method is a group of statements that performs some operations and may or may not return a result.

1. instance methods
2. class methods
3. static methods

### Method parameters
ðŸ‘‰ Method parameters make it possible to pass values to the method. 

ðŸ‘‰ In Python, the first parameter of the method should ALWAYS be **self** (discussed below) and which followed by the remaining parameters.

ðŸ‘‰  **self provides a reference to the calling object, that is the object to which the method or property belongs to.** 

ðŸ‘‰ If the user does not mention the self as the first argument, the first parameter will be treated for reference to the object.

**Note**: The self argument only needs to be passed in the method definition and not when the method is called.

### 1. instance methods
```python
class Employee:
    # defining the initializer
    def __init__(self, ID=None, salary=None, department=None):
        self.ID = ID
        self.salary = salary
        self.department = department

    def tax(self):
        return (self.salary * 0.2)

    def salaryPerDay(self):
        return (self.salary / 30)


# initializing an object of the Employee class
Gayatri = Employee(3789, 2500, "Human Resources")

# Printing properties of Steve
print("ID =", Gayatri.ID)
print("Salary", Gayatri.salary)
print("Department:", Gayatri.department)
print("Tax paid by Gayatri:", Gayatri.tax())
print("Salary per day of Gayatri", Gayatri.salaryPerDay())
```

### Function overloading in python

Lets walk through an example of **Explicitly overloading**:
```python
# to calculate area of rectangle
def area(length, breadth):    
    calc = length * breadth
    print calc
#to calculate area of square
def area(size):    
    calc =  size * size
    print calc
    
area(3)
area(4,5)
```
**Output:**

**9**

**TypeError: area() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)**



ðŸ‘‰ So when you define two functions with same names, the last one only matters ( area(size) in above). Thus area(3) works but area(4,5) gives

>TypeError: area() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)

ðŸ‘‰ In symbol table, key is function name here. Thus when another function with same name is encountered, in symbol table current key value pair is overridden. Hence, by default function overloading is not available.

ðŸ‘‰ methods cannot be explicitly overloaded in Python but can be implicitly overloaded.

#### Example of Implicitly overloading

```python
class Employee:
    # defining the properties and assigning them None to the
    def __init__(self, ID=None, salary=None, department=None):
        self.ID = ID
        self.salary = salary
        self.department = department

    # method overloading
    def demo(self, a, b, c, d=5, e=None):
        print("a =", a)
        print("b =", b)
        print("c =", c)
        print("d =", d)
        print("e =", e)

    def tax(self, title=None):
        return (self.salary * 0.2)

    def salaryPerDay(self):
        return (self.salary / 30)


# cerating an object of the Employee class
Steve = Employee()

# Printing properties of Steve
print("Demo 1")
Steve.demo(1, 2, 3)
print("\n")

print("Demo 2")
Steve.demo(1, 2, 3, 4)
print("\n")

print("Demo 3")
Steve.demo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

### 2. class methods
Class methods work with class variables and are accessible using the class name rather than its object. Since all class objects share the class variables, class methods are used to access and modify class variables.

>Class methods are accessed using the class name and can be accessed without creating a class object.

#### Syntax
ðŸ‘‰ To declare a method as a class method, we use the decorator **@classmethod**.

ðŸ‘‰ **cls** is used to refer to the class just like self is used to refer to the object of the class.

ðŸ‘‰ You can use any other name instead of cls, but cls is used as per convention, and we will continue to use this convention in our course.

ðŸ‘‰ Note: Just like instance methods, all class methods have at least one argument, cls.

```python
class MyClass:
    classVariable = 'educative'

    @classmethod
    def demo(cls):
        return cls.classVariable
```

##### Example:

```python
class Player:
    teamName = 'Liverpool'  # class variables

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # creating instance variables

    @classmethod
    def getTeamName(cls):
        return cls.teamName


print(Player.getTeamName())
```

### 3. static methods
Static methods are methods that are usually limited to class only and not their objects. They have no direct relation to class variables or instance variables. They are used as utility functions inside the class or when we do not want the inherited classes to modify a method definition.

Static methods can be accessed using the class name or the object name.

#### Syntax
ðŸ‘‰ To declare a method as a static method, we use the decorator **@staticmethod**. 

ðŸ‘‰ It does not use a reference to the object or class, so we do not have to use self or cls. 

ðŸ‘‰ We can pass as many arguments as we want and use this method to perform any function without interfering with the instance or class variables.

```python
class MyClass:

    @staticmethod
    def demo()
        print("I am a static method")      
```

```python
class Player:
    teamName = 'Liverpool'  # class variables

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # creating instance variables

    @staticmethod
    def demo():
        print("I am a static method.")


p1 = Player('lol')
p1.demo()
Player.demo()
```

ðŸ‘‰ Static methods do not know anything about the state of the class, i.e., they cannot modify class attributes. 

ðŸ‘‰ The purpose of a static method is to use its parameters and produce a useful result.

**Example**: Suppose that there is a class, BodyInfo, containing information about the physical attributes of a person. We can make a static method for calculating the BMI of any given weight and height:

```python
class BodyInfo:

    @staticmethod
    def bmi(weight, height):
        return weight / (height**2)


weight = 75
height = 1.8
print(BodyInfo.bmi(weight, height))
```
