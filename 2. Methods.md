## Implementing Methods in a Class

 Methods act as an interface between a program and the properties of a class in the program.
 
 A method is a group of statements that performs some operations and may or may not return a result.

1. instance methods
2. class methods
3. static methods

### Method parameters
ðŸ‘‰ Method parameters make it possible to pass values to the method. 

ðŸ‘‰ In Python, the first parameter of the method should ALWAYS be **self** (discussed below) and which followed by the remaining parameters.

ðŸ‘‰  **self provides a reference to the calling object, that is the object to which the method or property belongs to.** 

ðŸ‘‰ If the user does not mention the self as the first argument, the first parameter will be treated for reference to the object.

**Note**: The self argument only needs to be passed in the method definition and not when the method is called.

```python
class Employee:
    # defining the initializer
    def __init__(self, ID=None, salary=None, department=None):
        self.ID = ID
        self.salary = salary
        self.department = department

    def tax(self):
        return (self.salary * 0.2)

    def salaryPerDay(self):
        return (self.salary / 30)


# initializing an object of the Employee class
Gayatri = Employee(3789, 2500, "Human Resources")

# Printing properties of Steve
print("ID =", Gayatri.ID)
print("Salary", Gayatri.salary)
print("Department:", Gayatri.department)
print("Tax paid by Gayatri:", Gayatri.tax())
print("Salary per day of Gayatri", Gayatri.salaryPerDay())
```

### Function overloading in python

Lets walk through an example of **Explicitly overloading**:
```python
# to calculate area of rectangle
def area(length, breadth):    
    calc = length * breadth
    print calc
#to calculate area of square
def area(size):    
    calc =  size * size
    print calc
    
area(3)
area(4,5)
```
**Output:**

**9**

**TypeError: area() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)**



ðŸ‘‰ So when you define two functions with same names, the last one only matters ( area(size) in above). Thus area(3) works but area(4,5) gives

>TypeError: area() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)

ðŸ‘‰ In symbol table, key is function name here. Thus when another function with same name is encountered, in symbol table current key value pair is overridden. Hence, by default function overloading is not available.

ðŸ‘‰ methods cannot be explicitly overloaded in Python but can be implicitly overloaded.

#### Example of Implicitly overloading

```python
class Employee:
    # defining the properties and assigning them None to the
    def __init__(self, ID=None, salary=None, department=None):
        self.ID = ID
        self.salary = salary
        self.department = department

    # method overloading
    def demo(self, a, b, c, d=5, e=None):
        print("a =", a)
        print("b =", b)
        print("c =", c)
        print("d =", d)
        print("e =", e)

    def tax(self, title=None):
        return (self.salary * 0.2)

    def salaryPerDay(self):
        return (self.salary / 30)


# cerating an object of the Employee class
Steve = Employee()

# Printing properties of Steve
print("Demo 1")
Steve.demo(1, 2, 3)
print("\n")

print("Demo 2")
Steve.demo(1, 2, 3, 4)
print("\n")

print("Demo 3")
Steve.demo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```
