## What Is Inheritance?
Inheritance provides a way to create a new class from an existing class. The new class is a specialized version of the existing class such that it inherits all the non-private fields (variables) and methods of the existing class. The existing class is used as a starting point or as a base to create the new class.

## When do we use inheritance? 

Wherever we come across an IS A relationship between objects, we can use inheritance.

So, from the above descriptions of inheritance, we can conclude that we can build new classes by extending existing classes.

## The Python Object class

The primary purpose of object-oriented programming is to enable a programmer to model the real-world objects using a programming language.

In Python, whenever we create a class, it is, by default, a subclass of the built-in Python **object class**. 

This makes it an excellent example of inheritance in Python.


> **Parent Class (Super Class or Base Class):** This class allows the reuse of its public properties in another class.
> 
> **Child Class (Sub Class or Derived Class):** This class inherits or extends the superclass.

ðŸ‘‰ A child class has all public attributes of the parent class.

### Syntax:

```python
class ParentClass:
    # attributes of the parent class


class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    # attributes of the child class
```
### Ex:

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, make, color, model):
        self.make = make
        self.color = color
        self.model = model

    def printDetails(self):
        print("Manufacturer:", self.make)
        print("Color:", self.color)
        print("Model:", self.model)


class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, make, color, model, doors):
        # calling the constructor from parent class
        Vehicle.__init__(self, make, color, model)
        self.doors = doors

    def printCarDetails(self):
        self.printDetails()
        print("Doors:", self.doors)


obj1 = Car("Suzuki", "Grey", "2015", 4)
obj1.printCarDetails()
```

## What is the super() function?
