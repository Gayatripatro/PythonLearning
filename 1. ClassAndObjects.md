# Declaring a Class in Python

```python
class ClassName:
    pass
```    
- The class keyword tells the compiler that we are creating a custom class, which is followed by the class name and the : sign.
- All the properties and methods of the class will be defined within the class scope.


## Creating a class object
```python
class MyClass:
    pass
 
obj = MyClass()  # creating a MyClass Object
print(obj)
```

obj, will show the memory address at which this object is stored.

## Implementing Properties in a Class

```python
class Employee:
    # defining the properties and assigning them None
    ID = None
    salary = None
    department = None
 
 
# cerating an object of the Employee class
Steve = Employee()
 
# assigning values to properties of Steve - an object of the Employee class
Steve.ID = 3789
Steve.salary = 2500
Steve.department = "Human Resources"
# creating a new attribute for Steve
Steve.title = "Manager"
 
# Printing properties of Steve
print("ID =", Steve.ID)
print("Salary", Steve.salary)
print("Department:", Steve.department)
print("Title:", Steve.title)
``` 

## Initializing Objects
```python
class Employee:
    # defining the properties and assigning them None
    def __init__(self, ID, salary, department):
        self.ID = ID
        self.salary = salary
        self.department = department
 
 
# creating an object of the Employee class with default parameters
Steve = Employee(3789, 2500, "Human Resources")
 
# Printing properties of Steve
print("ID :", Steve.ID)
print("Salary :", Steve.salary)
print("Department :", Steve.department)

```
```python
class Employee:
    # defining the properties and assigning None to them
    def __init__(self, ID=None, salary=0, department=None):
        self.ID = ID
        self.salary = salary
        self.department = department
 
 
# creating an object of the Employee class with default parameters
Steve = Employee()
Mark = Employee("3789", 2500, "Human Resources")
 
# Printing properties of Steve and Mark
print("Steve")
print("ID :", Steve.ID)
print("Salary :", Steve.salary)
print("Department :", Steve.department)
print("Mark")
print("ID :", Mark.ID)
print("Salary :", Mark.salary)
print("Department :", Mark.department)
``` 

## Class and Instance Variables

In Python, properties can be defined into two parts:
1. Class variables
2. Instance variables

**Class variables**:  The class variables are shared by all instances or objects of the classes. A change in the class variable will change the value of that property in all the objects of the class.

**Instance variables**:  The instance variables are unique to each instance or object of the class. A change in the instance variable will change the value of the property in that specific object only.

```python
class Player:
    teamName = 'Liverpool'  # class variables
 
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # creating instance variables
 
 
p1 = Player('Mark')
p2 = Player('Steve')
 
print("Name:", p1.name)
print("Team Name:", p1.teamName)
print("Name:", p2.name)
print("Team Name:", p2.teamName)

```

***```__init__``` : The double underscores mean this is a special method that the Python interpreter will treat as a special case.***

ðŸ‘‰The self argument only needs to be passed in the method definition and not when the method is called.

```python
class Employee:
    # defining the initializer
    def __init__(self, ID=None, salary=None, department=None):
        self.ID = ID
        self.salary = salary
        self.department = department
    def tax(self):
        return (self.salary * 0.2)
    def salaryPerDay(self):
        return (self.salary / 30)
 
 
# initializing an object of the Employee class
Steve = Employee(3789, 2500, "Human Resources")
 
# Printing properties of Steve
print("ID =", Steve.ID)
print("Salary", Steve.salary)
print("Department:", Steve.department)
print("Tax paid by Steve:", Steve.tax())
print("Salary per day of Steve", Steve.salaryPerDay())
```
